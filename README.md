# Final-Project

In times like these I really wanted to create something that subtly educates the people as well as collect information about
the pandemic.

I created an online survey form which collects data about COVID-19 virus and also teaches the user about symptoms and 
preventative measures.

The code is written in HTML and styled using css.
